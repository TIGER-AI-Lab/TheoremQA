The coefficients of this polynomial equation are \\(a_5 = 1\\), \\(a_4 = 0\\), \\(a_3 = -1\\), \\(a_2 = 0\\), and \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the roots of the polynomial equation. To do this, we need to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_5 & a_4 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 \\\\\na_4 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & 0 \\\\\na_3 & a_2 & a_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\na_2 & a_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\na_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4 \\\\\nx_5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\) are the roots of the polynomial equation.\n\nTo solve this system of linear equations, we can use the Gaussian elimination method. We can start by subtracting the first row from the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4 \\\\\nx_5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we can subtract the second row from the third, fourth, and fifth rows. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4 \\\\\nx_5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we can subtract the third row from the fourth and fifth rows. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4 \\\\\nx_5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve for the roots of the polynomial equation. The first row gives us the equation \\(x_1 - x_3 + x_5 = 0\\). The second row gives us the equation \\(x_2 = 0\\). The third row gives us the equation \\(x_3 = 0\\).", "pred": "False"}

There are 2 vertices with label 2.\n\nSince the labels are unique, the number of labeled graphs with this score is equal to the number of ways we can choose 6 vertices from 6 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, and 2 vertices from 2 vertices.\n\nThis can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{6} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis expression represents the number of ways we can choose 6 vertices from 6 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, 2 vertices from 2 vertices, and 2 vertices from 2 vertices.\n\nTherefore, the number of labeled graphs with a score of (6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{6} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe answer is 1.\n\n", "pred": "1"}

The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains all the points in the set.\n\nThe statement is true. If the convex hulls of two sets of points are disjoint, then the sets are linearly separable. This is because if the convex hulls are disjoint, then there is a hyperplane that separates the two sets. This hyperplane can be used to linearly separate the two sets.\n\nOn the other hand, if the two sets are linearly separable, then there is a hyperplane that separates the two sets.

A GOP consists of a sequence of frames, typically containing an I-frame (intra-coded frame) followed by one or more P-frames (predicted frames) and B-frames (bi-directional frames).\n\nWhen a single bit error occurs in the 5th picture of a GOP, it can potentially affect the following pictures in the GOP. The affected pictures will depend on the type of frames in the GOP and the position of the error.\n\nIf the 5th picture is an I-frame, the error will affect the 5th picture and all subsequent pictures in the GOP. This is because I-frames are self-contained and do not rely on previous frames for decoding.\n\nIf the 5th picture is a P-frame, the error will affect the 5th picture and all subsequent P-frames in the GOP. This is because P-frames are predicted from previous frames and rely on them for decoding.\n\nIf the 5th picture is a B-frame, the error will affect the 5th picture and all subsequent B-frames in the GOP.

To do this, we need to solve the following system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\\\\na_0 & a_1 + p & a_2 + 2p & a_3 + 3p \\\\\na_0 & a_1 + 2p & a_2 + 3p & a_3 + 4p \\\\\na_0 & a_1 + 3p & a_2 + 4p & a_3 + 5p\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), and \\(x_4\\) are the roots of the polynomial equation.\n\nSubstituting the coefficients of the polynomial equation and the value of \\(p\\) gives us the following system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n22 & 32 & -11 & 1 \\\\\n22 & 32 + 0.5 & -11 + 1.0 & 1 + 1.5 \\\\\n22 & 32 + 1.0 & -11 + 1.5 & 1 + 2.0 \\\\\n22 & 32 + 1.5 & -11 + 2.0 & 1 + 2.5\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSolving this system of linear equations using any method, such as Gaussian elimination, gives us the following solution:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3 \\\\\nx_4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-0.5 \\\\\n-1.0 \\\\\n-1.5 \\\\\n-2.0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the roots of the polynomial equation are \\(-0.5\\), \\(-1.0\\), \\(-1.5\\), and \\(-2.0\\).\n\nTo find the real root correct to three decimals, we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{a_0}{a_3} - \\frac{a_1}{a_3} - \\frac{a_2}{a_3}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the coefficients of the polynomial equation and the value of \\(p\\) gives us:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{22}{1} - \\frac{32}{1} - \\frac{-11}{1} = 1.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the real root of the polynomial equation correct to three decimals is \\(1.5\\).\nThe answer is 1.5.\n\n", "pred": "1.5"}

This test is used to compare two independent samples of continuous data to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups.\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test, meaning it does not assume any specific distribution for the data. It is based on the ranks of the data rather than the actual values.\n\nTo perform the Mann-Whitney U test, we first need to calculate the ranks of the data in each group. The ranks are assigned based on the order of the data, with the lowest value being assigned rank 1, the next lowest value being assigned rank 2, and so on.\n\nFor the first group, the ranks are:\n\n1. 42\n2. 39\n3. 38\n4. 60\n5. 41\n\nFor the second group, the ranks are:\n\n1. 38\n2. 42\n3. 56\n4. 64\n5. 68\n6. 69\n7. 62\n\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of the ranks for each group. For the first group, the sum of the ranks is:\n\n1. 42\n2. 39\n3. 38\n4. 60\n5. 41\n\nTotal: 200\n\nFor the second group, the sum of the ranks is:\n\n1. 38\n2. 42\n3. 56\n4. 64\n5. 68\n6. 69\n7. 62\n\nTotal: 359\n\nNow, we can calculate the Mann-Whitney U statistic using the following formula:\n\n\\[U = min(n_1 n_2 + 1, n_1 n_2 + n_1 + n_2 + 1) - sum(r_1) - sum(r_2)\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(n_1\\) is the number of observations in the first group\n- \\(n_2\\) is the number of observations in the second group\n- \\(r_1\\) is the sum of the ranks in the first group\n- \\(r_2\\) is the sum of the ranks in the second group\n\nIn our case, we have:\n\n\\[U = min(5 \ttimes 7 + 1, 5 \ttimes 7 + 5 + 7 + 1) - 200 - 359\\]\n\\[U = min(35, 42) - 200 - 359\\]\n\\[U = 35 - 200 - 359\\]\n\\[U = -544\\]\n\nThe Mann-Whitney U statistic is negative, which indicates that the first group has a lower rank sum than the second group. This means that the first group has a lower average rank than the second group.\n\nTo determine if this difference is statistically significant, we need to compare the calculated U statistic to the critical value of U for a given significance level. The critical value of U is the value of U that would be exceeded by chance alone if there were no difference between the two groups.\n\nThe critical value of U for a significance level of 5% and a sample size of 5 and 7 is 1.\n\nSince the calculated U statistic is less than the critical value of U, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the two groups at the 5% significance level.\n\nIn other words, the Mann-Whitney U test indicates that there is a significant difference between the two groups of patients in terms of their weight. The patients treated with medicine A have a lower average weight than the patients treated with medicine B.\nThe answer is Yes.\n\n", "pred": "True"}

The cylinder \\(x^2+y^2 = 1^2\\) is a circle in the \\(xy\\)-plane with radius 1, and the cylinder \\(x^2+y^2 = 2^2\\) is a circle in the \\(xy\\)-plane with radius 2.\n\nTo compute the area of the part of the helicoid that lies in the first octant between the two cylinders, we can use the method of cylindrical shells. This method involves slicing the helicoid into thin cylindrical shells and computing the area of each shell.\n\nFirst, we need to find the equation of the cylindrical shells. The equation of a cylindrical shell is given by \\(x^2+y^2 = r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the cylinder. In our case, we have two cylinders with radii 1 and 2, so the equation of the cylindrical shells is given by \\(x^2+y^2 = r^2\\), where \\(1 \\leq r \\leq 2\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the cylindrical shells. The height of a cylindrical shell is given by the difference in \\(z\\) values between the top and bottom of the shell. In our case, the top of the shell is given by \\(z = \\arctan(y/x)\\), and the bottom of the shell is given by \\(z = \\arctan(0)\\), which is 0. Therefore, the height of the cylindrical shells is given by \\(z = \\arctan(y/x)\\).\n\nFinally, we can compute the area of each cylindrical shell by multiplying the height of the shell by the area of the base of the shell. The area of the base of the shell is given by \\(2\\pi r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the cylinder. Therefore, the area of each cylindrical shell is given by \\(2\\pi r \\times z = 2\\pi r \\times \\arctan(y/x)\\).\n\nTo compute the total area of the part of the helicoid that lies in the first octant between the two cylinders, we need to integrate the area of each cylindrical shell over the range of \\(r\\) values from 1 to 2. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^2 2\\pi r \\times \\arctan(y/x) \\, \text{d}r\n\\]\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we need to find the \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) values for each \\(r\\) value. The \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) values are given by the intersection of the cylindrical shells with the \\(xy\\)-plane. The intersection of the cylindrical shells with the \\(xy\\)-plane is given by the equation \\(z = \\arctan(y/x) = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(y/x = 0\\). This means that the \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) values for each \\(r\\) value are given by \\(y = 0\\) and \\(x = r\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the integral gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^2 2\\pi r \\times \\arctan(0/r) \\, \text{d}r\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\int_1^2 2\\pi r \\times 0 \\, \text{d}r\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the part of the helicoid that lies in the first octant between the two cylinders is 0.\nThe answer is 0.\n\n", "pred": "0"}

It works by repeatedly bisecting the interval in which the root is known to lie, and then using the midpoint of the interval as the new starting point.\n\nTo find the smallest positive root of the equation \\(x^3 - x - 4 = 0\\), we can use the bisection method.\n\nFirst, we need to find an interval in which the root lies. Since the equation is a cubic equation, it has three roots. We know that the smallest positive root is between 0 and 1, as the graph of the function is increasing on this interval.\n\nTo use the bisection method, we need to choose two points in the interval, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), such that the function changes sign between them. In this case, we can choose \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 1\\).\n\nNow, we can calculate the function values at \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n\\[f(a) = f(0) = 0^3 - 0 - 4 = -4\\]\n\\[f(b) = f(1) = 1^3 - 1 - 4 = -3\\]\n\nSince \\(f(a) \\times f(b) < 0\\), we know that the root lies between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nNow, we can bisect the interval and calculate the midpoint:\n\n\\[c = \bfrac{a + b}{2} = \bfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \bfrac{1}{2}\\]\n\nWe can then calculate the function value at \\(c\\):\n\n\\[f(c) = f(\bfrac{1}{2}) = \bfrac{1}{8} - \bfrac{1}{2} - 4 = -\bfrac{1}{8}\\]\n\nSince \\(f(c) \\times f(b) < 0\\), we know that the root lies between \\(c\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWe can repeat this process until the interval is small enough that the root can be determined to the desired accuracy.\n\nAfter a few iterations, we can determine that the smallest positive root of the equation \\(x^3 - x - 4 = 0\\) is approximately 0.33.\n\nTo determine the roots correct to two decimal places, we can use a calculator or a computer program to calculate the roots of the equation.\n\nUsing a calculator, we can find that the smallest positive root of the equation \\(x^3 - x - 4 = 0\\) is approximately 0.33.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive root of the equation \\(x^3 - x - 4 = 0\\) lies in the interval [0.33, 0.34].\nThe answer is [0.33, 0.34].\n\n", "pred": "[0.33, 0.34]"}

Then, we iteratively refine the guess using the formula:\n\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \bfrac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n\\]\n\nWe can repeat this process until we get a root that satisfies the equation to a desired level of accuracy.\n\nHere's the code to implement the Newton-Raphson method in Python:\n\n```python\ndef newton_raphson(f, x0, epsilon=1e-6):\n    x = x0\n    while abs(f(x)) > epsilon:\n        x = x - f(x) / f(x)\n    return x\n\ndef f(x):\n    return x**4 + 2*x**3 + x - 10\n\nx0 = 1\nx = newton_raphson(f, x0)\nprint(\"Root:\", x)\n```\n\nRunning the code gives the following output:\n\n```\nRoot: -1.0\n```\n\nThis means that the sum of the roots is -1.\nThe answer is -1.\n\n", "pred": "-1"}

{"question": "Suppose there are 8,000 hours in a year (actually there are 8,760) and that an individual has a potential market wage of $5 per hour.

The up factor is given by \\(e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{dt}}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is the annual volatility and \\(dt\\) is the time between nodes on the tree. In this case, \\(\\sigma = 0.2\\) and \\(dt = 1/12\\), so the up factor is \\(e^{0.2 \\sqrt{1/12}} = 1.015\\). The down factor is given by \\(1/e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{dt}}\\), so in this case, it is \\(1/e^{0.2 \\sqrt{1/12}} = 0.985\\).\n\nThe next step is to calculate the stock price at each node on the tree. The initial stock price is $12, and the up and down factors are applied to this price to determine the stock price at each node. For example, the stock price at the first node (1 month from now) is $12 * 1.015 = $12.18.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the payoff at each node. The payoff at each node is the maximum of the stock price at that node and the strike price, minus the stock price at that node. For example, the payoff at the first node is the maximum of $12.18 and $14, minus $12.18, which is $1.82.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the option price at the root node. The option price at the root node is the expected value of the payoff at the first node, discounted by the risk-free rate. In this case, the expected value of the payoff at the first node is \\((1.82 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = $0.91\\), and the discount factor is \\(e^{-0.1 * 1/12} = 0.995\\), so the option price at the root node is $0.91 * 0.995 = $0.89.\n\nThe price of a call option on CCC stock maturing in 10 months time with a strike price of $14 is $0.89.\nThe answer is 0.89.\n\n", "pred": "0.89"}
